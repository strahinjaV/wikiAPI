A simple API that does CRUD operations on a database
using RESTful API methods

you need to first download all dependencies
npm install

then start your mongoDB server
mongod

the programs used to initialize some data was Studio3T 
-create a database and name it wikiDB
-create a collection called "articles"

and you can then populate the database with some sample data
{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5c139771d79ac8eac11e754a"),
    "title" : "API",
    "content" : "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer."
}


{
    "_id" : ObjectId("5c1398aad79ac8eac11e7561"),
    "title" : "Bootstrap",
    "content" : "This is a framework developed by Twitter that contains pre-made front-end templates for web design"

    "title" : "DOM",
    "content" : "The Document Object Model is like an API for interacting with our HTML"
}

or

    "title" : "Jack Bauer",
    "content" : "Jack Bauer once stepped into quicksand. The quicksand couldn't escape and nearly drowned.",
    "__v" : 0
}

the commands then are put into the program "Postman" for testing

using GET for route "/articles" retrieves all articles
      POST         "/articles" adds an articles
      DELETE       "/articles" deletes all articles

using GET for route "/articles/:articleTitle  ex. /articles/REST retrieves the specific article
      PUT                                                        will replace the data (there is a comment in the app.js code regarding the difference between PUT and PATCH)
      PATCH                                                      will replace the data 
      DELETE                                                     deletes the specific article
